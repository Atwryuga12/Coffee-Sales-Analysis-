# Coffee-Sales-Analysis-
This project focuses on analyzing coffee sales data to derive actionable insights, optimize sales strategies, and improve business decision-making. It employs SQL for data querying and aggregation and Power BI for creating an interactive dashboard to visualize trends, patterns, and key metrics.

**Objectives**

Identify sales trends over time (monthly and daily) to uncover high-performing periods.
Highlight the most popular products, customer preferences, and other performance metrics.
Create an interactive dashboard for stakeholders to explore insights dynamically.

**Components**
Data Analysis Using SQL and Data visualization using Power BI

Queries were written to calculate and summarize essential metrics, including:
Total Revenue: Summing up sales figures.
Total Orders: Counting the total number of transactions.
Monthly Sales Trends: Grouping and ranking revenues by months.
Daily Sales Trends: Analyzing revenues across days of the week.
Average Sales per day and Average Orders per day

An interactive dashboard (Coffee Sales Analysis.pbix) was designed to visualize the insights derived from the data. Key features include:
Revenue and Order KPIs: At-a-glance display of total revenue and order counts.
Time-Based Trends: Line charts for monthly and daily sales, highlighting peak and low-performance periods.
